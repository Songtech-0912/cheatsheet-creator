# TODO

I would rather there be like an html template that you could just run a Python live server with the name of the cheatsheet markdown file, and it would auto-update the cheatsheet on localhost. Or something like a javascript based implementation so it's literally just editing one HTML file and everything is self-contained in one separate script file and some initialization code. In fact, I like the idea of these one-HTML-file webapps.
